# PHP MVC Simple Posts App using Bootstrap 4

This is a simple posts app built with PHP (OOP) using a custom built MVC framework based on TraversyMVC.  There are a couple of changes that need to be make before you can use the app for yourself.

Go to app/config/config.php and edit the following:
- Database username
- Database password
- Database name
- URLROOT
- Site Name

Go to the 'public' folder and edit the .htaccess file - add your root directory.

Import database.sql into your MySQL database.

That should be enough to get you going.
